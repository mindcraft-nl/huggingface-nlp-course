              " 'text': 'Epidemiology of hypoxaemia in children with acute lower respiratory infection.\\nTo determine the prevalence of hypoxaemia in children aged under 5 years suffering acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), the risk factors for hypoxaemia in children under 5 years of age with ALRI, and the association of hypoxaemia with an increased risk of dying in children of the same age. Systematic review of the published literature. Out-patient clinics, emergency departments and hospitalisation wards in 23 health centres from 10 countries. Cohort studies reporting the frequency of hypoxaemia in children under 5 years of age with ALRI, and the association between hypoxaemia and the risk of dying. Prevalence of hypoxaemia measured in children with ARI and relative risks for the association between the severity of illness and the frequency of hypoxaemia, and between hypoxaemia and the risk of dying. Seventeen published studies were found that included 4,021 children under 5 with acute respiratory infections (ARI) and reported the prevalence of hypoxaemia. Out-patient children and those with a clinical diagnosis of upper ARI had a low risk of hypoxaemia (pooled estimate of 6% to 9%). The prevalence increased to 31% and to 43% in patients in emergency departments and in cases with clinical pneumonia, respectively, and it was even higher among hospitalised children (47%) and in those with radiographically confirmed pneumonia (72%). The cumulated data also suggest that hypoxaemia is more frequent in children living at high altitude. Three papers reported an association between hypoxaemia and death, with relative risks varying between 1.4 and 4.6. Papers describing predictors of hypoxaemia have focused on clinical signs for detecting hypoxaemia rather than on identifying risk factors for developing this complication. Hypoxaemia is a common and potentially lethal complication of ALRI in children under 5, particularly among those with severe disease and those living at high altitude. Given the observed high prevalence of hypoxaemia and its likely association with increased mortality, efforts should be made to improve the detection of hypoxaemia and to provide oxygen earlier to more children with severe ALRI.',\n",

Bone marrow cellularity diminishes with age and elderly patients may have decreased tolerance to myelosuppressive agents. Between November 1995 and October 1999, 68 chemotherapy-naive elderly (70 or more years old) patients with histologically or cytologically proven lung cancer who were to receive platinum-based chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. All patients had adequate cardiac, hematological, liver and renal function to receive chemotherapy. Patients were randomized into 3 groups. Patients in groups 1 and 2 received 2 microg/kg and 4 microg/kg granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, lenograstim), respectively, when grade 3 leukopenia (<2,000/microl) or neutropenia (<1,000/microl) appeared after chemotherapy. Patients in group 3 received 2 microg/kg G-CSF when grade 2 leukopenia (<3,000/microl) or neutropenia (<1,500/microl) appeared after chemotherapy. G-CSF was stopped in all groups when the leukocyte count increased to over 10,000/microl or the neutrophil count exceeded 5,000/microl. Full blood cell counts were examined 3 times a week after chemotherapy. All patients received platinum-based chemotherapy. Eighteen, 16 and 22 patients (78%, 73% and 96%) in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, received G-CSF when leukopenia or neutropenia appeared. The durations of G-CSF treatment required by groups 1 and 3 (5.7+/-3.6 and 6.6+/-3.2 days, respectively) did not differ significantly, but the duration of treatment required by group 2 (3.7+/-2.8 days) was significantly shorter than that of group 1 (p=0.048). The duration of grade 4 neutropenia in group 2 (0.7+/-1.1 days) was marginally shorter than that in group 1 (1.6+/-2.1 days, p=0.076). The neutrophil nadir of group 2 (949+/-757/microl) was marginally higher than that of group 1 (592+/-438/microl, p=0.058). No patients in group 2 experienced grade 4 neutropenia for 4 days or more or a neutrophil nadir less than 100/microl a significant difference from group 1, where 22% and 17% of patients experienced these events (p=0.02 and p=0.04, respectively). Similarly, no infections requiring antibiotics after chemotherapy occurred in patients in group 2, a significant difference from group 1 (26%, p=0.01). The rates of neutropenia and infection in groups 1 and 3 did not differ significantly. The peak plasma concentration of G-CSF in group 2 was significantly higher than in group 1 (p=0.0018), but did not differ significantly between groups 1 and 3. Doubling the dose of G-CSF could help to decrease neutropenia and prevent infection after chemotherapy in elderly patients with lung cancer.'}"

Systematic review of the published literature. Out-patient clinics, emergency departments and hospitalisation wards in 23 health centres from 10 countries. Cohort studies reporting the frequency of hypoxaemia in children under 5 years of age with ALRI, and the association between hypoxaemia and the risk of dying. Prevalence of hypoxaemia measured in children with ARI and relative risks for the association between the severity of illness and the frequency of hypoxaemia, and between hypoxaemia and the risk of dying. Seventeen published studies were found that included 4,021 children under 5 with acute respiratory infections (ARI) and reported the prevalence of hypoxaemia. Out-patient children and those with a clinical diagnosis of upper ARI had a low risk of hypoxaemia (pooled estimate of 6% to 9%). The prevalence increased to 31% and to 43% in patients in emergency departments and in cases with clinical pneumonia, respectively, and it was even higher among hospitalised children (47%) and in those with radiographically confirmed pneumonia (72%). The cumulated data also suggest that hypoxaemia is more frequent in children living at high altitude. Three papers reported an association between hypoxaemia and death, with relative risks varying between 1.4 and 4.6. Papers describing predictors of hypoxaemia have focused on clinical signs for detecting hypoxaemia rather than on identifying risk factors for developing this complication. Hypoxaemia is a common and potentially lethal complication of ALRI in children under 5, particularly among those with severe disease and those living at high altitude. Given the observed high prevalence of hypoxaemia and its likely association with increased mortality, efforts should be made to improve the detection of hypoxaemia and to provide oxygen earlier to more children with severe ALRI.'},\n",

In most developing countries, where the majority of deaths from pneumonia occur, facilities for early detection of hypoxaemia are lacking and oxygen is in short supply. This review examines the usefulness of different clinical signs and symptoms in the prediction of hypoxaemia associated with acute respiratory infections in children. Several respiratory signs were found to be associated with hypoxaemia. These include very fast breathing (with a respiratory rate of more than 60 or 70 breaths per minute), cyanosis, grunting, nasal flaring, chest retractions, head nodding and auscultatory signs, as well as signs of general depression of the child, such as inability to feed or lethargy. The sensitivity and specificity of these signs, as described in the reviewed studies, is presented, and combination rules are discussed. Through appropriate combination of several physical signs, which can be used by peripheral health workers and be taught to mothers, it is possible to predict hypoxaemia in children with acute respiratory tract infections with reasonable accuracy.'},\n",

Prospective evaluation of children with severe or very severe pneumonia. SpO2 was measured at the time of presentation and every day until hypoxaemia resolved. Children with a SpO2 less than 85% received supplemental oxygen. By comparing with a retrospective control group for whom oxygen administration was guided by clinical signs, we evaluated whether there was a survival advantage from using a protocol for the administration of oxygen based on pulse oximetry. We determined normal values for oxygen saturation in children living in the highlands. In 151 well, normal highland children, the mean SpO2 was 95.7% (SD 2.7%). The median SpO2 among children with severe or very severe pneumonia was 70% (56-77); 376 (53.5%) had moderate hypoxaemia (SpO2 70-84%); 202 (28.7%) had severe hypoxaemia (SpO2 50-69%); and 125 (17.8%) had very severe hypoxaemia (SpO2 < 50%). Longer duration of cough or the presence of hepatomegaly or cyanosis predicted more severe degrees of hypoxaemia. After 10, 20 and 30 days from the beginning of treatment, respectively 102 (14.5%), 38 (5.4%) and 19 (2.7%) of children had persistent hypoxaemia; 46 children (6.5%) died. Predictors of death were low SpO2 on presentation, severe malnutrition, measles and history of cough for more than 7 days. The mortality risk ratio between the 703 children managed whose oxygen administration was guided by the use of pulse oximetry and the retrospective control group who received supplemental oxygen based on clinical signs was 0.65 (95%CI 0.41-1.02, two-sided Fisher's exact test, P = 0.07). There is a need to increase the availability of supplemental oxygen in smaller health facilities in developing countries, and to train health workers to recognise the clinical signs and risk factors for hypoxaemia. In moderate sized hospitals a protocol for the administration of oxygen based on pulse oximetry may improve survival.\"},\n",

Lilly, First Deputy Attorney General of Hawaii, argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief was James H. Dannenberg, Deputy Attorney General.\\nRobert Gilbert Johnston argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Clayton C. Ikei.[*]\\n*240 JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nThe issue in this case is whether the transfer of a prisoner from a state prison in Hawaii to one in California implicates a liberty interest within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\n\\nI\\n\\nA\\nRespondent Delbert Kaahanui Wakinekona is serving a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole as a result of his murder conviction in a Hawaii state court. He also is serving sentences for various other crimes, including rape, robbery, and escape. At the Hawaii State Prison outside Honolulu, respondent was classified as a maximum security risk and placed in the maximum control unit.\\nPetitioner Antone Olim is the Administrator of the Hawaii State Prison. The other petitioners constituted a prison \"Program Committee.\" On August 2, 1976, the Committee held hearings to determine the reasons for a breakdown in discipline and the failure of certain programs within the prison\\'s maximum control unit. Inmates of the unit appeared at these hearings. The Committee singled out respondent and another inmate as troublemakers. On August 5, respondent received notice that the Committee, at a hearing to be held on August 10, would review his correctional program to determine whether his classification within the system should be changed and whether he should be transferred to another Hawaii facility or to a mainland institution.\\n*241 The August 10 hearing was conducted by the same persons who had presided over the hearings on August 2. Respondent retained counsel to represent him. The Committee recommended that respondent\\'s classification as a maximum security risk be continued and that he be transferred to a prison on the mainland. He received the following explanation from the Committee:\\n\"The Program Committee, having reviewed your entire file, your testimony and arguments by your counsel, concluded that your control classification remains at Maximum. You are still considered a security risk in view of your escapes and subsequent convictions for serious felonies. The Committee noted the progress you made in vocational training and your expressed desire to continue in this endeavor. However your relationship with staff, who reported that you threaten and intimidate them, raises grave concerns regarding your potential for further disruptive and violent behavior. Since there is no other Maximum security prison in Hawaii which can offer you the correctional programs you require and you cannot remain at [the maximum control unit] because of impending construction of a new facility, the Program Committee recommends your transfer to an institution on the mainland.\" App. 7-8.\\nPetitioner Olim, as Administrator, accepted the Committee\\'s recommendation, and a few days later respondent was transferred to Folsom State Prison in California.\\n\\nB\\nRule IV of the Supplementary Rules and Regulations of the Corrections Division, Department of Social Services and Housing, State of Hawaii, approved in June 1976, recites that the inmate classification process is not concerned with punishment. Rather, it is intended to promote the best interests *242 of the inmate, the State, and the prison community.[1] Paragraph 3 of Rule IV requires a hearing prior to a prison transfer involving \"a grievous loss to the inmate,\" which the Rule defines \"generally\" as \"a serious loss to a reasonable man.\" App. 21.[2] The Administrator, under ¶ 2 of the Rule, is required to establish \"an impartial Program Committee\" to conduct such a hearing, the Committee to be \"composed of at least three members who were not actively involved in the process by which the inmate . . . was brought before the Committee.\" App. 20. Under ¶ 3, the Committee must give the inmate written notice of the hearing, permit him, with certain stated exceptions, to confront and cross-examine witnesses, afford him an opportunity to be heard, and apprise him of the Committee\\'s findings. App. 21-24.[3]\\nThe Committee is directed to make a recommendation to the Administrator, who then decides what action to take:\\n\"[The Administrator] may, as the final decisionmaker:\\n\"(a) Affirm or reverse, in whole or in part, the recommendation; or\\n\"(b) hold in abeyance any action he believes jeopardizes the safety, security, or welfare of the staff, inmate *243. . . , other inmates . . . , institution, or community and refer the matter back to the Program Committee for further study and recommendation.\" Rule IV, ¶ 3d(3), App. 24.\\nThe regulations contain no standards governing the Administrator\\'s exercise of his discretion. See Lono v. Ariyoshi, 63 Haw. 138, 144-145, 621 P. 2d 976, 980-981 (1981).\\n\\nC\\nRespondent filed suit under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 against petitioners as the state officials who caused his transfer. He alleged that he had been denied procedural due process because the Committee that recommended his transfer consisted of the same persons who had initiated the hearing, this being in specific violation of Rule IV, ¶ 2, and because the Committee was biased against him. The United States District Court for the District of Hawaii dismissed the complaint, holding that the Hawaii regulations governing prison transfers do not create a substantive liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. 459 F. Supp. 473 (1978).[4]\\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, by a divided vote, reversed. 664 F. 2d 708 (1981). It held that Hawaii had created a constitutionally protected liberty interest by promulgating Rule IV. In so doing, the court declined to follow cases from other Courts of Appeals holding that certain procedures mandated by prison transfer regulations do not create a liberty interest. See, e. g., Cofone v. Manson, 594 F. 2d 934 (CA2 1979); Lombardo v. Meachum, 548 F. 2d 13 (CA1 1977). The court reasoned that Rule IV gives Hawaii prisoners a justifiable expectation that they will not be transferred to the mainland absent a hearing, before an impartial committee, concerning the facts alleged in the *244 prehearing notice.[5] Because the Court of Appeals\\' decision created a conflict among the Circuits, and because the case presents the further question whether the Due Process Clause in and of itself protects against interstate prison transfers, we granted certiorari. 456 U. S. 1005 (1982).\\n\\nII\\nIn Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215 (1976), and Montanye v. Haymes, 427 U. S. 236 (1976), this Court held that an intrastate prison transfer does not directly implicate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In Meachum, inmates at a Massachusetts medium security prison had been transferred to a maximum security prison in that Commonwealth. In Montanye, a companion case, an inmate had been transferred from one maximum security New York prison to another as punishment for a breach of prison rules. This Court rejected \"the notion that any grievous loss visited upon a person by the State is sufficient to invoke the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause.\" Meachum, 427 U. S., at 224 (emphasis in original). It went on to state:\\n\"The initial decision to assign the convict to a particular institution is not subject to audit under the Due Process Clause, although the degree of confinement in one prison may be quite different from that in another. The conviction has sufficiently extinguished the defendant\\'s liberty *245 interest to empower the State to confine him in any of its prisons.\\n\"Neither, in our view, does the Due Process Clause in and of itself protect a duly convicted prisoner against transfer from one institution to another within the state prison system. Confinement in any of the State\\'s institutions is within the normal limits or range of custody which the conviction has authorized the State to impose.\" Id., at 224-225 (emphasis in original).\\nThe Court observed that, although prisoners retain a residuum of liberty, see Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, 555-556 (1974), a holding that \"any substantial deprivation imposed by prison authorities triggers the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause would subject to judicial review a wide spectrum of discretionary actions that traditionally have been the business of prison administrators rather than of the federal courts.\" 427 U. S., at 225 (emphasis in original).\\nApplying the Meachum and Montanye principles in Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480 (1980), this Court held that the transfer of an inmate from a prison to a mental hospital did implicate a liberty interest. Placement in the mental hospital was \"not within the range of conditions of confinement to which a prison sentence subjects an individual,\" because it brought about \"consequences . . . qualitatively different from the punishment characteristically suffered by a person convicted of crime.\" Id., at 493. Respondent argues that the same is true of confinement of a Hawaii prisoner on the mainland, and that Vitek therefore controls.\\nWe do not agree. Just as an inmate has no justifiable expectation that he will be incarcerated in any particular prison within a State, he has no justifiable expectation that he will be incarcerated in any particular State.[6] Often, confinement *246 in the inmate\\'s home State will not be possible. A person convicted of a federal crime in a State without a federal correctional facility usually will serve his sentence in another State. Overcrowding and the need to separate particular prisoners may necessitate interstate transfers. For any number of reasons, a State may lack prison facilities capable of providing appropriate correctional programs for all offenders.\\nStatutes and interstate agreements recognize that, from time to time, it is necessary to transfer inmates to prisons in other States. On the federal level, 18 U. S. C. § 5003(a) authorizes the Attorney General to contract with a State for the transfer of a state prisoner to a federal prison, whether in that State or another. See Howe v. Smith, 452 U. S. 473 (1981).[7] Title 18 U. S. C. § 4002 (1976 ed. and Supp. V) permits the Attorney General to contract with any State for the placement of a federal prisoner in state custody for up to three years. Neither statute requires that the prisoner remain in the State in which he was convicted and sentenced.\\nOn the state level, many States have statutes providing for the transfer of a state prisoner to a federal prison, e. g., Haw. Rev. Stat. § 353-18 (1976), or another State\\'s prison, e. g., Alaska Stat. Ann. § 33.30.100 (1982). Corrections compacts between States, implemented by statutes, authorize incarceration of a prisoner of one State in another State\\'s prison. See, e. g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. § 11189 (West 1982) (codifying Interstate Corrections Compact); § 11190 (codifying Western Interstate Corrections Compact); Conn. Gen. *247 Stat. § 18-102 (1981) (codifying New England Interstate Corrections Compact); § 18-106 (codifying Interstate Corrections Compact); Haw. Rev. Stat. § 355-1 (1976) (codifying Western Interstate Corrections Compact); Idaho Code § 20-701 (1979) (codifying Interstate Corrections Compact); Ky. Rev. Stat. § 196.610 (1982) (same). And prison regulations such as Hawaii\\'s Rule IV anticipate that inmates sometimes will be transferred to prisons in other States.\\nIn short, it is neither unreasonable nor unusual for an inmate to serve practically his entire sentence in a State other than the one in which he was convicted and sentenced, or to be transferred to an out-of-state prison after serving a portion of his sentence in his home State. Confinement in another State, unlike confinement in a mental institution, is \"within the normal limits or range of custody which the conviction has authorized the State to impose.\" Meachum, 427 U. S., at 225.[8] Even when, as here, the transfer involves long distances and an ocean crossing, the confinement remains within constitutional limits. The difference between such a transfer and an intrastate or interstate transfer of *248 shorter distance is a matter of degree, not of kind,[9] and Meachum instructs that \"the determining factor is the nature of the interest involved rather than its weight.\" 427 U. S., at 224. The reasoning of Meachum and Montanye compels the conclusion that an interstate prison transfer, including one from Hawaii to California, does not deprive an inmate of any liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause in and of itself.\\n\\nIII\\nThe Court of Appeals held that Hawaii\\'s prison regulations create a constitutionally protected liberty interest. In Meachum, however, the State had \"conferred no right on the *249 prisoner to remain in the prison to which he was initially assigned, defeasible only upon proof of specific acts of misconduct,\" 427 U. S., at 226, and \"ha[d] not represented that transfers [would] occur only on the occurrence of certain events,\" id., at 228. Because the State had retained \"discretion to transfer [the prisoner] for whatever reason or for no reason at all,\" ibid., the Court found that the State had not created a constitutionally protected liberty interest. Similarly, because the state law at issue in Montanye \"impose[d] no conditions on the discretionary power to transfer,\" 427 U. S., at 243, there was no basis for invoking the protections of the Due Process Clause.\\nThese cases demonstrate that a State creates a protected liberty interest by placing substantive limitations on official discretion. An inmate must show \"that particularized standards or criteria guide the State\\'s decisionmakers.\" Connecticut Board of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U. S. 458, 467 (1981) (BRENNAN, J., concurring). If the decisionmaker is not \"required to base its decisions on objective and defined criteria,\" but instead \"can deny the requested relief for any constitutionally permissible reason or for no reason at all,\" ibid., the State has not created a constitutionally protected liberty interest. See id., at 466-467 (opinion of the Court); see also Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S., at 488-491 (summarizing cases).\\nHawaii\\'s prison regulations place no substantive limitations on official discretion and thus create no liberty interest entitled to protection under the Due Process Clause. As Rule IV itself makes clear, and as the Supreme Court of Hawaii has held in Lono v. Ariyoshi, 63 Haw., at 144-145, 621 P. 2d, at 980-981, the prison Administrator\\'s discretion to transfer an inmate is completely unfettered. No standards govern or restrict the Administrator\\'s determination. Because the Administrator is the only decisionmaker under Rule IV, we need not decide whether the introductory paragraph *250 of Rule IV, see n. 1, supra, places any substantive limitations on the purely advisory Program Committee.[10]\\nThe Court of Appeals thus erred in attributing significance to the fact that the prison regulations require a particular kind of hearing before the Administrator can exercise his unfettered discretion.[11] As the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit recently stated in Shango v. Jurich, 681 F. 2d 1091, 1100-1101 (1982), \"[a] liberty interest is of course a substantive interest of an individual; it cannot be the right to demand needless formality.\"[12] Process is not an end in itself. Its constitutional purpose is to protect a substantive interest to which the individual has a legitimate claim of entitlement. See generally Simon, Liberty and Property in the Supreme Court: A Defense of Roth and Perry, 71 Calif. L. Rev. 146, 186 (1983). If officials may transfer a prisoner \"for whatever reason or for no reason at all,\" Meachum, 427 U. S., at 228, there is no such interest for process to protect. The State may choose to require procedures for reasons other than protection against deprivation of substantive *251 rights, of course,[13] but in making that choice the State does not create an independent substantive right. See Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U. S. 460, 471 (1983).\\n\\nIV\\nIn sum, we hold that the transfer of respondent from Hawaii to California did not implicate the Due Process Clause directly, and that Hawaii\\'s prison regulations do not create a protected liberty interest.[14] Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\\nReversed.\\nJUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, and with whom JUSTICE STEVENS joins as to Part I, dissenting.\\nIn my view, the transfer of respondent Delbert Kaahanui Wakinekona from a prison in Hawaii to a prison in California implicated an interest in liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. I respectfully dissent.\\n\\nI\\nAn inmate\\'s liberty interest is not limited to whatever a State chooses to bestow upon him. An inmate retains a significant residuum of constitutionally protected liberty following his incarceration independent of any state law. As we stated in Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, 555-556 (1974): \"[A] prisoner is not wholly stripped of constitutional protections when he is imprisoned for crime. There is no iron curtain drawn between the Constitution and the prisons *252 of this country. . . . [Prisoners] may not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\"\\nIn determining whether a change in the conditions of imprisonment implicates a prisoner\\'s retained liberty interest, the relevant question is whether the change constitutes a sufficiently \"grievous loss\" to trigger the protection of due process. Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480, 488 (1980). See Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, 481 (1972), citing Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U. S. 123, 168 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). The answer depends in part on a comparison of \"the treatment of the particular prisoner with the customary, habitual treatment of the population of the prison as a whole.\" Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U. S. 460, 486 (1983) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). This principle was established in our decision in Vitek, which held that the transfer of an inmate from a prison to a mental hospital implicated a liberty interest because it brought about \"consequences . . . qualitatively different from the punishment characteristically suffered by a person convicted of crime.\" 445 U. S., at 493. Because a significant qualitative change in the conditions of confinement is not \"within the range of conditions of confinement to which a prison sentence subjects an individual,\" ibid., such a change implicates a prisoner\\'s protected liberty interest.\\nThere can be little doubt that the transfer of Wakinekona from a Hawaii prison to a prison in California represents a substantial qualitative change in the conditions of his confinement. In addition to being incarcerated, which is the ordinary consequence of a criminal conviction and sentence, Wakinekona has in effect been banished from his home, a punishment historically considered to be \"among the severest.\"[1] For an indeterminate period of time, possibly the *253 rest of his life, nearly 2,500 miles of ocean will separate him from his family and friends. As a practical matter, Wakinekona may be entirely cut off from his only contacts with the outside world, just as if he had been imprisoned in an institution which prohibited visits by outsiders. Surely the isolation imposed on him by the transfer is far more drastic than that which normally accompanies imprisonment.\\nI cannot agree with the Court that Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215 (1976), and Montanye v. Haymes, 427 U. S. 236, 243 (1976), compel the conclusion that Wakinekona\\'s transfer implicates no liberty interest. Ante, at 248. Both cases involved transfers of prisoners between institutions located within the same State in which they were convicted, and the Court expressly phrased its holdings in terms of intrastate transfers.[2] Both decisions rested on the premise that no liberty interest is implicated by an initial decision to place a prisoner in one institution in the State rather than another. See Meachum, supra, at 224; Montanye, supra, at 243. On the basis of that premise, the Court concluded that the subsequent transfer of a prisoner to a different facility within the State likewise implicates no liberty interest. In this case, however, we cannot assume that a State\\'s initial placement of an individual in a prison far removed from his family and residence would raise no due process questions. None of our *254 prior decisions has indicated that such a decision would be immune from scrutiny under the Due Process Clause.\\nActual experience simply does not bear out the Court\\'s assumptions that interstate transfers are routine and that it is \"not unusual\" for a prisoner \"to serve practically his entire sentence in a State other than the one in which he was convicted and sentenced.\" Ante, at 247. In Hawaii less than three percent of the state prisoners were transferred to prisons in other jurisdictions in 1979, and on a nationwide basis less than one percent of the prisoners held in state institutions were transferred to other jurisdictions.[3] Moreover, the vast majority of state prisoners are held in facilities located less than 250 miles from their homes.[4] Measured against these norms, Wakinekona\\'s transfer to a California prison represents a punishment \"qualitively different from the punishment characteristically suffered by a person convicted of crime.\" Vitek v. Jones, supra, at 493.\\nI therefore cannot agree that a State may transfer its prisoners at will, to any place, for any reason, without ever implicating any interest in liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.\\n\\nII\\nNor can I agree with the majority\\'s conclusion that Hawaii\\'s prison regulations do not create a liberty interest. This Court\\'s prior decisions establish that a liberty interest *255 may be \"created\"[5] by state laws, prison rules, regulations, or practices. State laws that impose substantive criteria which limit or guide the discretion of officials have been held to create a protected liberty interest. See, e. g., Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U. S. 460 (1983); Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539 (1974); Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U. S. 1 (1979); Wright v. Enomoto, 462 F. Supp. 397 (ND Cal. 1976), summarily aff\\'d, 434 U. S. 1052 (1978). By contrast, a liberty interest is not created by a law which \"imposes no conditions on [prison officials\\'] discretionary power,\" Montanye, supra, at 243, authorizes prison officials to act \"for whatever reason or for no reason at all,\" Meachum, supra, at 228, or accords officials \"unfettered discretion,\" Connecticut Board of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U. S. 458, 466 (1981).\\nThe Court misapplies these principles in concluding that Hawaii\\'s prison regulations leave prison officials with unfettered discretion to transfer inmates. Ante, at 249-250. Rule IV establishes a scheme under which inmates are classified upon initial placement in an institution, and must subsequently be reclassified before they can be transferred to another institution. Under the Rule the standard for classifying inmates is their \"optimum placement within the Corrections Division\" in light of the \"best interests of the individual, the State, and the community.\"[6] In classifying inmates, the Program *256 Committee may not consider punitive aims. It may consider only factors relevant to determining where the individual will be \"best situated,\" such as \"his history, his changing needs, the resources and facilities available to the Corrections Divisions, the other inmates/wards, the exigencies of the community, and any other relevant factors.\" Paragraph 3 of Rule IV establishes a detailed set of procedures applicable when, as in this case, the reclassification of a prisoner may lead to a transfer involving a \"grievous loss,\" a phrase contained in the Rule itself.[7] The procedural rules are cast in mandatory language, and cover such matters as notice, access to information, hearing, confrontation and cross-examination, and the basis on which the Committee is to make its recommendation to the facility administrator.\\nThe limitations imposed by Rule IV are at least as substantial as those found sufficient to create a liberty interest in Hewitt v. Helms, supra, decided earlier this Term. In Hewitt an inmate contended that his confinement in administrative custody implicated an interest in liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. State law provided that a prison official could place inmates in administrative custody \"upon his assessment of the situation and the need for control,\" or \"where it has been determined that there is a threat of a serious disturbance, or a serious threat to the individual or others,\" and mandated certain procedures such as notice and a *257 hearing.[8] This Court construed the phrases \" `the need for control,\\' or `the threat of a serious disturbance,\\' \" as \"substantive predicates\" which restricted official discretion. Id., at 472. These restrictions, in combination with the mandatory procedural safeguards, \"deman[ded] a conclusion that the State has created a protected liberty interest.\" Ibid.\\nRule IV is not distinguishable in any meaningful respect from the provisions at issue in Helms. The procedural requirements contained in Rule IV are, if anything, far more elaborate than those involved in Helms, and are likewise couched in \"language of an unmistakably mandatory character.\" Id., at 471. Moreover, Rule IV, to no less an extent than the state law at issue in Helms, imposes substantive criteria restricting official discretion. In Helms this Court held that a statutory phrase such as \"the need for control\" constituted a limitation on the discretion of prison officials to place inmates in administrative custody. In my view Rule IV, which states that transfers are intended to ensure an inmate\\'s \"optimum placement\" in accordance with considerations which include \"his changing needs [and] the resources and facilities available to the Corrections Division,\" also restricts official discretion in ordering transfers.[9]\\nThe Court suggests that, even if the Program Committee does not have unlimited discretion in making recommendations for classifications and transfers, this cannot give rise to a state-created liberty interest because the prison Administrator retains \"completely unfettered\" \"discretion to transfer *258 an inmate,\" ante, at 249. I disagree. Rule IV, ¶ 3(d)(3), provides for review by the prison Administrator of recommendations forwarded to him by the Program Committee.[10] Even if this provision must be construed as authorizing the Administrator to transfer a prisoner for wholly arbitrary reasons,[11] that mere possibility does not defeat the protectible expectation otherwise created by Hawaii\\'s reclassification and transfer scheme that transfers will take place only if required to ensure an inmate\\'s optimum placement. In Helms a prison regulation also left open the possibility that the Superintendent could decide, for any reason or no reason at all, whether an inmate should be confined in administrative custody.[12] This Court nevertheless held that the state scheme as a whole created an interest in liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. 459 U. S., at 471-472. Helms thus necessarily rejects the view that state laws which impose substantive *259 limitations and elaborate procedural requirements on official conduct create no liberty interest solely because there remains the possibility that an official will act in an arbitrary manner at the end of the process.[13]\\nFor the foregoing reasons, I dissent.\\nNOTES\\n[*]  Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the State of Alaska et al. by Paul L.

La Follette of Wisconsin.\\n[1]  Paragraph 1 of Rule IV states:\\n\\n\"An inmate\\'s . . . classification determines where he is best situated within the Corrections Division. Rather than being concerned with isolated aspects of the individual or punishment (as is the adjustment process), classification is a dynamic process which considers the individual, his history, his changing needs, the resources and facilities available to the Corrections Division, the other inmates . . . , the exigencies of the community, and any other relevant factors. It never inflicts punishment; on the contrary, even the imposition of a stricter classification is intended to be in the best interests of the individual, the State, and the community. In short, classification is a continuing evaluation of each individual to ensure that he is given the optimum placement within the Corrections Division.\" App. 20.\\n[2]  Petitioners concede, \"for purposes of the argument,\" that respondent suffered a \"grievous loss\" within the meaning of Rule IV when he was transferred from Hawaii to the mainland. Tr. of Oral Arg. 9, 25.\\n[3]  Rule V provides that an inmate may retain legal counsel if his hearing concerns a \"potential Interstate transfer.\" App. 25.\\n[4]  Respondent also had alleged that the transfer violated the Hawaii Constitution and state regulations and statutes. In light of its dismissal of respondent\\'s federal claims, the District Court declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over these state-law claims. 459 F. Supp., at 476.\\n[5]  Several months before the Court of Appeals handed down its decision, the Supreme Court of Hawaii had held that because Hawaii\\'s prison regulations do not limit the Administrator\\'s discretion to transfer prisoners to the mainland, they do not create any liberty interest. Lono v. Ariyoshi, 63 Haw. 138, 621 P. 2d 976 (1981). In a petition for rehearing in the present case, petitioners directed the Ninth Circuit\\'s attention to the Lono decision. See 664 F. 2d, at 714. The Court of Appeals, however, concluded that the Hawaii court\\'s interpretation of the regulations was not different from its own; the Hawaii court merely had reached a different result on the \"federal question.\" The Court of Appeals thus adhered to its resolution of the case. Id., at 714-715.\\n[6]  Indeed, in Vitek itself the Court did not read Meachum and Montanye as stating a rule applicable only to intrastate transfers. The Court stated: \"In Meachum v. Fano . . . and Montanye v. Haymes . . . we held that the transfer of a prisoner from one prison to another does not infringe a protected liberty interest.\" 445 U. S., at 489 (emphasis added). The Court\\'s other cases describing Meachum and Montanye also have eschewed the narrow reading respondent now proposes. See Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U. S. 460, 467-468 (1983); Moody v. Daggett, 429 U. S. 78, 88, n. 9 (1976).\\n[7]  This statute has been invoked to transfer prisoners from Hawaii state facilities to federal prisons on the mainland. See Anthony v. Wilkinson, 637 F. 2d 1130 (CA7 1980), vacated and remanded sub nom. Hawaii v. Mederios, 453 U. S. 902 (1981).\\n[8]  After the decisions in Meachum and Montanye, courts almost uniformly have held that an inmate has no entitlement to remain in a prison in his home State. See Beshaw v. Fenton, 635 F. 2d 239, 246-247 (CA3 1980), cert. denied, 453 U. S. 912 (1981); Cofone v. Manson, 594 F. 2d 934, 937, n. 4 (CA2 1979); Sisbarro v. Warden, 592 F. 2d 1, 3 (CA1), cert. denied, 444 U. S. 849 (1979); Fletcher v. Warden, 467 F. Supp. 777, 779-780 (Kan. 1979); Curry-Bey v. Jackson, 422 F. Supp. 926, 931-933 (DC 1976); McDonnell v. United States Attorney General, 420 F. Supp. 217, 220 (ED Ill. 1976); Goodnow v. Perrin, 120 N. H. 669, 671, 421 A. 2d 1008, 1010 (1980); Girouard v. Hogan, 135 Vt. 448, 449-450, 378 A. 2d 105, 106-107 (1977); In re Young, 95 Wash. 2d 216, 227-228, 622 P. 2d 373, 379 (1980); cf. Fajeriak v. McGinnis, 493 F. 2d 468 (CA9 1974) (pre-Meachum transfers from Alaska to other States); Hillen v. Director of Department of Social Services, 455 F. 2d 510 (CA9), cert. denied, 409 U. S. 989 (1972) (pre-Meachum transfer from Hawaii to California). But see In re Young, 95 Wash. 2d, at 233, 622 P. 2d, at 382 (concurring opinion); State ex rel. Olson v. Maxwell, 259 N. W. 2d 621 (N. D. 1977); cf. Tai v. Thompson, 387 F. Supp. 912 (Haw. 1975) (pre-Meachum transfer).\\n[9]  Respondent\\'s argument to the contrary is unpersuasive. The Court in Montanye took note that among the hardships that may result from a prison transfer are separation of the inmate from home and family, separation from inmate friends, placement in a new and possibly hostile environment, difficulty in making contact with counsel, and interruption of educational and rehabilitative programs. 427 U. S., at 241, n. 4. These are the same hardships respondent faces as a result of his transfer from Hawaii to California.\\n\\nRespondent attempts to analogize his transfer to banishment in the English sense of \"beyond the seas,\" arguing that banishment surely is not within the range of confinement justified by his sentence. But respondent in no sense has been banished; his conviction, not the transfer, deprived him of his right freely to inhabit the State. The fact that his confinement takes place outside Hawaii is merely a fortuitous consequence of the fact that he must be confined, not an additional element of his punishment. See Girouard v. Hogan, 135 Vt., at 449-450, 378 A. 2d, at 106-107. Moreover, respondent has not been exiled; he remains within the United States.\\nIn essence, respondent\\'s banishment argument simply restates his claim that a transfer from Hawaii to the mainland is different in kind from other transfers. As has been shown in the text, however, respondent\\'s transfer was authorized by his conviction. A conviction, whether in Hawaii, Alaska, or one of the contiguous 48 States, empowers the State to confine the inmate in any penal institution in any State unless there is state law to the contrary or the reason for confining the inmate in a particular institution is itself constitutionally impermissible. See Montanye, 427 U. S., at 242; id., at 244 (dissenting opinion); Cruz v. Beto, 405 U. S. 319 (1972); Fajeriak v. McGinnis, 493 F. 2d, at 470.\\n[10]  In Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U. S. 460 (1983), unlike this case, state law limited the decisionmakers\\' discretion. To the extent the dissent doubts that the Administrator\\'s discretion under Rule IV is truly unfettered, post, at 258, and n. 11, it doubts the ability or authority of the Hawaii Supreme Court to construe state law.\\n[11]  In Meachum itself, the Court of Appeals had interpreted the applicable regulations as entitling inmates to a pretransfer hearing, see Fano v. Meachum, 520 F. 2d 374, 379-380 (CA1 1975), but this Court held that state law created no liberty interest.\\n[12]  Other courts agree that an expectation of receiving process is not, without more, a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. See, e. g., United States v. Jiles, 658 F. 2d 194, 200 (CA3 1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S. 923 (1982); Bills v. Henderson, 631 F. 2d 1287, 1298-1299 (CA6 1980); Pugliese v. Nelson, 617 F. 2d 916, 924-925 (CA2 1980); Cofone v. Manson, 594 F. 2d, at 938; Lombardo v. Meachum, 548 F. 2d 13, 14-16 (CA1 1977); Adams v. Wainwright, 512 F. Supp. 948, 953 (ND Fla. 1981); Lono v. Ariyoshi, 63 Haw., at 144-145, 621 P. 2d, at 980-981.\\n[13]  Petitioners assert that the hearings required by Rule IV not only enable the officials to gather information and thereby to exercise their discretion intelligently, but also have a therapeutic purpose: inmate participation in the decisionmaking process, it is hoped, reduces tension in the prison. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 52-53.\\n[14]  In light of this conclusion, respondent\\'s claim of bias in the composition of the prison Program Committee becomes irrelevant.\\n[1]  4 J. Elliott, Debates on the Federal Constitution 555 (1836). Whether it is called banishment, exile, deportation, relegation, or transportation, compelling a person \"to quit a city, place, or country, for a specified period of time, or for life,\" has long been considered a unique and severe deprivation, and was specifically outlawed by \"[t]he twelfth section of the English Habeas Corpus Act, 31 Car. II, one of the three great muniments of English liberty.\" United States v. Ju Toy, 198 U. S. 253, 269-270 (1905) (Brewer, J., dissenting).\\n[2]  Thus in Meachum the Court stated that the State, by convicting the defendant, was \"empower[ed] to confine him in any of its prisons,\" 427 U. S., at 224 (emphasis deleted), that a \"transfer from one institution to another within the state prison system\" implicated no due process interest, id., at 225, and that \"[c]onfinement in any of the State\\'s institutions is within the normal limits or range of custody which the conviction has authorized the State to impose.\" Ibid. See also Montanye, 427 U. S., at 242 (\"We held in Meachum v. Fano, that no Due Process Clause liberty interest of a duly convicted prison inmate is infringed when he is transferred from one prison to another within the State\").\\n[3]  U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics \\x97 1981, Table 6.27, pp. 478-479 (T. Flanagan, D. Van Alstyne, & M. Gottfredson eds. 1982). These figures reflect \"all inmates who were transferred from one State\\'s jurisdiction to another to continue sentences already in force,\" and \"[d]oes not include the release if [the] State does not relinquish jurisdiction.\" Id., at 590.\\n[4]  U. S. Dept. of Justice, Profile of State Prison Inmates: Sociodemographic Findings from the 1974 Survey of Inmates of State Correctional Facilities 1 (1979). Over 70 percent of state inmates are held in institutions located less than 250 miles from their homes.\\n[5]  But see Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U. S. 460, 488 (1983) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (Prison regulations \"provide evidentiary support for the conclusion that the transfer affects a constitutionally protected interest in liberty,\" but they \"do not create that interest\" (emphasis in original)).\\n[6]  Paragraph 1 of Rule IV provides:\\n\\n\"An inmate\\'s/ward\\'s classification determines where he is best situated within the Corrections Division. Rather than being concerned with isolated aspects of the individual or punishment (as is the adjustment process), classification is a dynamic process which considers the individual, his history, his changing needs, the resources and facilities available to the Corrections Division, the other inmates/wards, the exigencies of the community, and any other relevant factors. It never inflicts punishment; on the contrary, even the imposition of a stricter classification is intended to be in the best interests of the individual, the State, and the community. In short, classification is a continuing evaluation of each individual to ensure that he is given the optimum placement within the Corrections Division.\" App. 20.\\n[7]  While the term \"grievous loss\" is not explicitly defined, the prison regulations treat a transfer to the mainland as a grievous loss entitling an inmate to the procedural rights established in Rule IV, ¶ 3. This is readily inferred from Rule IV, ¶ 3, which states that intrastate transfers do not involve a grievous loss, and Rule V, which permits inmates to retain counsel only in specified circumstances, one of which is a reclassification that may result in an interstate transfer. App. 25.\\n[8]  See 459 U. S., at 470-471, n. 6.\\n[9]  See also Wright v. Enomoto, 462 F. Supp. 397 (ND Cal. 1976), summarily aff\\'d, 434 U. S. 1052 (1978). In that case, the District Court held that the language of a prison policy statement, stating that \"[i]nmates may be segregated for medical, psychiatric, disciplinary, or administrative reasons,\" 462 F. Supp., at 403, was sufficient to create a protected expectation that an inmate would not be segregated for arbitrary reasons. See also Bills v. Henderson, 631 F. 2d 1287, 1293 (CA6 1980), cert. denied, 449 U. S. 1093 (1981); Winsett v. McGinnes, 617 F. 2d 996, 107 (CA3 1980) (en banc).\\n[10]  Rule IV, ¶ 3(d)(3), provides:\\n\\n\"The facility administrator will, within a reasonable period of time, review the Program Committee\\'s recommendation. He may, as the final decisionmaker:\\n\"(a) Affirm or reverse, in whole or in part, the recommendation; or\\n\"(b) hold in abeyance any action he believes jeopardizes the safety, security, or welfare of the staff, inmate/ward, other inmates/wards, institution, or community and refer the matter back to the Program Committee for further study and recommendation.\" App. 21.\\n[11]  I doubt that Rule IV would be construed to permit the Administrator to order a transfer for punitive reasons, since Rule IV expressly disallows punitive transfers.\\n[12]  That provision stated: \"All decisions of the Program Review Committee shall be reviewed by the Superintendent for his sustaining the decision or amending or reversing the decision in favor of the inmate.\" Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction Administrative Directive BC-ADM 801, Rule III(H)(7). App. to Brief for Respondent in Hewitt v. Helms, O. T. 1982, No. 81-638, p. 12a. Because an inmate could be confined in administrative custody only if the Program Review Committee determined that such confinement is and continues to be \"appropriate,\" id., at 18a, the Superintendent in Helms was the \"decisionmaker,\" ante, at 249-250, who determined whether inmates would be held in administrative custody.\\n[13]  This view was also implicitly rejected in Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U. S. 1 (1979). The Court held that the Nebraska statute governing the decision whether or not to grant parole created a \"protectible entitlement,\" id., at 12, even though the statute, which listed a number of factors to be considered in the parole decision, also authorized the Parole Board to deny parole on the basis of \"[a]ny other factors the board determines to be relevant.\" Id., at 18.\\n\\nTo the extent that Lono v. Ariyoshi, 63 Haw. 138, 144-145, 621 P. 2d 976, 980-981 (1981), on which the majority relies, ante, at 249, suggests that no liberty interest is created as state law has not entirely eliminated the possibility of arbitrary action, it is inconsistent with both Helms and Greenholtz.\\n'}"

              "{'text': 'It is done, and submitted. You can play “Survival of the Tastiest” on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multi-touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing.\\n\\nThere’s a lot I’d like to talk about. I’ll go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list.\\n\\nConcept\\n\\nWorking over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks I had to face.\\n\\nOriginally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise – something with lots of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident I could fit any theme around it.\\n\\nIn the end, the problem with a theme like “Evolution” in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game?\\n\\nIn a game, you need to control something to reach an objective. That control goes against what evolution is supposed to be like. If you allow the user to pick how to evolve something, it’s not evolution anymore – it’s the equivalent of intelligent design, the fable invented by creationists to combat the very idea of evolution. Being agnostic and a Pastafarian, that’s not something that rubbed me the right way.\\n\\nHence, my biggest dillema when deciding what to create was not with what I wanted to create, but with what I did not. I didn’t want to create an “intelligent design” simulator and wrongly call it evolution.\\n\\nThis is a problem, of course, every other contestant also had to face. And judging by the entries submitted, not many managed to work around it. I’d say the only real solution was through the use of artificial selection, somehow. So far, I haven’t seen any entry using this at its core gameplay.\\n\\nAlas, this is just a fun competition and after a while I decided not to be as strict with the game idea, and allowed myself to pick whatever I thought would work out.\\n\\nMy initial idea was to create something where humanity tried to evolve to a next level but had some kind of foe trying to stop them from doing so. I kind of had this image of human souls flying in space towards a monolith or a space baby (all based in 2001: A Space Odyssey of course) but I couldn’t think of compelling (read: serious) mechanics for that.\\n\\nBorgs were my next inspiration, as their whole hypothesis fit pretty well into the evolution theme. But how to make it work? Are you the borg, or fighting the Borg?\\n\\nThe third and final idea came to me through my girlfriend, who somehow gave me the idea of making something about the evolution of Pasta. The more I thought about it the more it sounded like it would work, so I decided to go with it.\\n\\nConversations with my inspiring co-worker Roushey (who also created the “Mechanical Underdogs” signature logo for my intros) further matured the concept, as it involved into the idea of having individual pieces of pasta flying around and trying to evolve until they became all-powerful. A secondary idea here was that the game would work to explain how the Flying Spaghetti Monster came to exist – by evolving from a normal dinner table.\\n\\nSo the idea evolved more or less into this: you are sitting a table. You have your own plate, with is your “base”. There are 5 other guests at the table, each with their own plate.\\n\\nYour plate can spawn little pieces of pasta. You do so by “ordering” them through a menu. Some pastas are better than others; some are faster, some are stronger. They have varying costs, which are debited from your credits (you start with a number of credits).\\n\\nOnce spawned, your pastas start flying around. Their instinct is to fly to other plates, in order to conquer them (the objective of the game is having your pasta conquer all the plates on the table). But they are really autonomous, so after being spawned, you have no control over your pasta (think DotA or LoL creeps).\\n\\nYour pasta doesn’t like other people’s pasta, so if they meet, they shoot sauce at each other until one dies. You get credits for other pastas your own pasta kill.\\n\\nOnce a pasta is in the vicinity of a plate, it starts conquering it for its team. It takes around 10 seconds for a plate to be conquered; less if more pasta from the same team are around. If pasta from other team are around, though, they get locked down in their attempt, unable to conquer the plate, until one of them die (think Battlefield’s standard “Conquest” mode).\\n\\nYou get points every second for every plate you own.\\n\\nOver time, the concept also evolved to use an Italian bistro as its main scenario.\\n\\nCarlos, Carlos’ Bistro’s founder and owner\\n\\nSetup\\n\\nNo major changes were made from my work setup. I used FDT and Starling creating an Adobe AIR (ActionScript) project, all tools or frameworks I already had some knowledge with.\\n\\nOne big change for me was that I livestreamed my work through a twitch.tv account. This was a new thing for me. As recommended by Roushey, I used a program called XSplit and I got to say, it is pretty amazing. It made the livestream pretty effortless and the features are awesome, even for the free version. It was great to have some of my friends watch me, and then interact with them and random people through chat. It was also good knowing that I was also recording a local version of the files, so I could make a timelapse video later.\\n\\nKnowing the video was being recorded also made me a lot more self-conscious about my computer use, as if someone was watching over my shoulder. It made me realize that sometimes I spend too much time in seemingly inane tasks (I ended up wasting the longest time just to get some text alignment the way I wanted – it’ll probably drive someone crazy if they watch it) and that I do way too many typos where writing code. I pretty much spend half of the time writing a line and the other half fixing the crazy characters in it.\\n\\nMy own stream was probably boring to watch since I was coding for the most time. But livestreaming is one of the cool things to do as a spectator too. It was great seeing other people working – I had a few tabs opened on my second monitor all the time. It’s actually a bit sad, because if I could, I could have spent the whole weekend just watching other people working! But I had to do my own work, so I’d only do it once in a while, when resting for a bit.\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nAlthough I wanted some simple, low-fi, high-contrast kind of design, I ended up going with somewhat realistic (vector) art. I think it worked very well, fitting the mood of the game, but I also went overboard.\\n\\nFor example: to know the state of a plate (who owns it, who’s conquering it and how much time they have left before conquering it, which pasta units are in the queue, etc), you have to look at the plate’s bill.\\n\\nThe problem I realized when doing some tests is that people never look at the bill! They think it’s some kind of prop, so they never actually read its details.\\n\\nPlus, if you’re zoomed out too much, you can’t actually read it, so it’s hard to know what’s going on with the game until you zoom in to the area of a specific plate.\\n\\nOne other solution that didn’t turn out to be as perfect as I thought was how to indicate who a plate base belongs to. In the game, that’s indicated by the plate’s decoration – its color denotes the team owner. But it’s something that fits so well into the design that people never realized it, until they were told about it.\\n\\nIn the end, the idea of going with a full physical metaphor is one that should be done with care. Things that are very important risk becoming background noise, unless the player knows its importance.\\n\\nOriginally, I wanted to avoid any kind of heads-up display in my game. In the end, I ended up adding it at the bottom to indicate your credits and bases owned, as well as the hideous out-of-place-and-still-not-obvious “Call Waiter” button. But in hindsight, I should have gone with a simple HUD from the start, especially one that indicated each team’s colors and general state of the game without the need for zooming in and out.\\n\\nDevelopment\\n\\nDevelopment went fast. But not fast enough.\\n\\nEven though I worked around 32+ hours for this Ludum Dare, the biggest problem I had to face in the end was overscoping. I had too much planned, and couldn’t get it all done.\\n\\nContent-wise, I had several kinds of pasta planned (Wikipedia is just amazing in that regard), split into several different groups, from small Pastina to huge Pasta al forno. But because of time constraints, I ended up scratching most of them, and ended up with 5 different types of very small pasta – barely something to start when talking about the evolution of Pasta.\\n\\nPastas used in the game. Unfortunately, the macs where never used\\n\\nWhich is one of the saddest things about the project, really. It had the framework and the features to allow an endless number of elements in there, but I just didn’t have time to draw the rest of the assets needed (something I loved to do, by the way).\\n\\nOther non-obvious features had to be dropped, too. For example, when ordering some pasta, you were supposed to select what kind of sauce you’d like with your pasta, each with different attributes. Bolognese, for example, is very strong, but inaccurate; Pesto is very accurate and has great range, but it’s weaker; and my favorite, Vodka, would triggers 10% loss of speed on the pasta hit by it.\\n\\nThe code for that is mostly in there. But in the end, I didn’t have time to implement the sauce selection interface; all pasta ended up using bolognese sauce.\\n\\nTo-do list: lots of things were not done\\n\\nActual programming also took a toll in the development time. Having been programming for a while, I like to believe I got to a point where I know how to make things right, but at the expense of forgetting how to do things wrong in a seemingly good way. What I mean is that I had to take a lot of shortcuts in my code to save time (e.g. a lot of singletons references for cross-communication rather than events or observers, all-encompassing check loops, not fast enough) that left a very sour taste in my mouth. While I know I used to do those a few years ago and survive, I almost cannot accept the state my code is in right now.\\n\\nAt the same time, I do know it was the right thing to do given the timeframe.\\n\\nOne small thing that had some impact was using a somewhat new platform for me. That’s Starling, the accelerated graphics framework I used in Flash. I had tested it before and I knew how to use it well – the API is very similar to Flash itself. However, there were some small details that had some impact during development, making me feel somewhat uneasy the whole time I was writing the game. It was, again, the right thing to do, but I should have used Starling more deeply before (which is the conundrum: I used it for Ludum Dare just so I could learn more about it).\\n\\nArgument and user experience\\n\\nOne final aspect of the game that I learned is that making the game obvious for your players goes a long way into making it fun. If you have to spend the longest time explaining things, your game is doing something wrong.\\n\\nAnd that’s exactly the problem Survival of the Tastiest ultimately faced. It’s very hard for people to understand what’s going on with the game, why, and how. I did have some introductory text at the beginning, but that was a last-minute thing. More importantly, I should have had a better interface or simplified the whole concept so it would be easier for people to understand.\\n\\nThat doesn’t mean the game itself should be simple. It just means that the experience and interface should be approachable and understandable.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nI’m extremely happy with what I’ve done and, especially given that this was my first Ludum Dare. However, I feel like I’ve learned a lot of what not to do.\\n\\nThe biggest problem is overscoping. Like Eric Decker said, the biggest lesson we can learn with this is probably with scoping – deciding what to do beforehand in a way you can complete it without having to rush and do something half-assed.\\n\\nI’m sure I will do more Ludum Dares in the future. But if there are any lessons I can take of it, they are to make it simple, to use frameworks and platforms you already have some absolute experience with (otherwise you’ll spend too much time trying to solve easy questions), and to scope for a game that you can complete in one day only (that way, you can actually take two days and make it cool).\\n\\nThis entry was posted\\non Monday, August 27th, 2012 at 10:54 am and is filed under LD #24.\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can skip to the end and leave a response.
